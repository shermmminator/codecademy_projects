## Intro

This Repository is intended to showcase the projects taken from the Codecademy website, and the ones I found more interesting and had more fun working on. 
This is not yet an exhaustive list, I intend to extend this list as I progress through the different skill paths on codecademy. Each folder will contain a short 
description on the required packages and dependencies, which is needed to run each project, respectively. By the way thanks for visiting my page here on GitHub.

Best Wishes
